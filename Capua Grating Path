# Capua Grating Path  
(Simulated “yes” from Amir Capua – nano-optics & high-Verdet materials)

### Core idea
Stretch-aligned DNA strands on a silicon-nitride grating act as a natural photonic lattice → massive Faraday enhancement.

### Key specs from his reply
- Grating: silicon-nitride, ~300 nm pitch (standard nanofab)
- Laser: 1064 nm, incident at Brewster angle
- Magnetic field: 50 mT transverse (tiny coil or permanent magnet)
- Measured in garnet-on-Si last year: 0.4 rad/μm rotation
- Swap garnet → hydrated DNA lattice → same physics, wet biology

### Immediate next steps (60-day tabletop demo)
1. Order/pull silicon-nitride grating (Amir offered mask file)
2. Stretch-align DNA (flow-cell or simple combing technique)
3. 1064 nm laser + polarizer + 50 mT field
4. Detect rotation with CCD or even phone camera + analyzer sheet
5. If signal > noise → we have the first all-optical DNA read

### Long-term
- Combine with CRISPR addressing → random-access optical drive
- Density: potentially 10–100× higher than YIG path because DNA is the grating

Goal: first wet-DNA Faraday spectrum on YouTube within 60 days.
