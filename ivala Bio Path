# Nivala Bio Path (Simulated "yes" from Jeff Nivala)

- Plate biotin-tagged DNA on glass slide  
- Sandwich with thin garnet film + polarizer  
- Terbium- or bismuth-doped nucleotides (replace one phosphate or sugar)  
- 1.55 μm laser + 100–200 mT magnetic coil  
- Measure Faraday rotation with polarimeter (or phone camera + cheap polarizer sheet)  
- If the light twists → film it → post video to repo  

### Bonus / Next level  
- Add Cas9/dCas9 handles → random-access bits  
- Source terbium conjugates from Sigma-Aldrich (~$200)  

Goal: 30-day proof-of-concept rotation video
